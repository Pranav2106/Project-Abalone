## Project Abalone 

This project was developed by Pranav Chobdar and Max Jeltes as a part of project from University of Twente.

The Abalone project is a Java-based implementation of the classic multiplayer board game. The game is designed to be played by 2 to 4 players and challenges players to use strategy and skill to maneuver their marbles on the game board with the goal of pushing their opponent's marbles off the edge.

The implementation leverages multithreading and client-server communication to allow players to host a LAN game. This enables multiple players to join and play the game together in a local network setting, making it a great choice for playing with friends or family.

In addition to allowing multiplayer gaming, the Abalone game also includes an AI player, allowing players to practice and improve their skills even when playing alone. The AI player is implemented using advanced algorithms and is designed to provide a challenging and realistic opponent for players.

The game is developed using Java, a popular and powerful programming language that is well-suited for building complex applications like this. The implementation will follow the standard rules of the Abalone game and will provide an intuitive and engaging gaming experience for players.

The development of the Abalone game is being carried out with the goal of creating a highly functional and aesthetically pleasing implementation that can be used by players of all skill levels. The project is being hosted on GitHub, which provides a platform for developers to collaborate, contribute, and share code with others.

This project provides an opportunity for developers to showcase their skills in Java programming, multithreading, client-server communication, and AI development. It will also be a great addition to a developer's portfolio, as it demonstrates their ability to take on a challenging project and bring it to completion.

Overall, the Abalone project is an exciting and worthwhile endeavor for developers looking to improve their skills, work with others, and create a fun and engaging game for players to enjoy."
